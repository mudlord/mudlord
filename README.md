- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m mudlord. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software RE, democoding, and sometimes emulation. Sometimes other random code too.
- ðŸ‘‰ Please note the development practises of code/RE:
   - All code/RE is done in spare time, **whenever I feel like**.
   - There is never any ETA when things are done. Things are done **"when its done"**.
   - All code first and foremost is done for own self benefit. If other people like it, thats just a bonus.
   - Consider all code non-production worthy. Use with **extreme** caution and at own risk.
   - All code is released without any warranties, etc.
