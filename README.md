- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m mudlord. Tripcode on 4ch is "mudlord !/0nkQb4ahI" 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software RE, democoding, and sometimes emulation. Sometimes other random code too.
- ðŸ‘‰ Please note the development practises of code/RE:
   - All code/RE first and foremost is done for my own self benefit, in my spare time.
   - All code/RE is done **whenever I feel like** and **when its done**.
   - Use **at own risk**. All code/RE is released without any warranties, etc.
