- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m mudlord. Tripcode on 4ch is "**!!zCxksKXqg/2**" 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software RE, democoding, and sometimes emulation. Sometimes other random code too.
- ðŸ‘‰ Please note the development practises of code/RE:
   - All code/RE first and foremost is done for my own self benefit, in my spare time.
   - All code/RE is done **whenever I feel like** and **when its done**.
   - Use **at own risk**. All code/RE is released without any warranties, etc.
   - Pretty much **all** code here is released into the [public domain](https://github.com/mudlord/einweggerat/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Feel free to leech/steal/sellwithoutcredit/etc.
